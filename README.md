# Flappybird-Landingpage

##Synopsis
This project was meant to teach how to effectively use a mobile-first approach in designing a landing page. As well as how to create 
an effective landing page thats appealing to users and easy to navigate with a quick load time(Pages that take too long to load cause 
users to abandon it).  This page was also used as an introduction to using velocity, an animation package written with javascript. Play 
button is broken, just meant to help create a landing page not the game.
